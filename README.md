# Dopamine Network Simulation

This is a small Python-based neural simulation demonstrating how a 
dopamine-like parameter can modulate the firing behaviour of a simple 
spiking neuron network.

### What this simulation does
- Models 100 leaky integrate-and-fire neurons  
- Applies random recurrent connectivity  
- Uses a `dopamine_level` parameter to scale synaptic weights  
- Shows how increased dopamine produces higher mean firing rates  

### Why I built this
This project connects my background in MRI signal modelling and ophthalmic 
imaging with neurocomputational modelling. It reflects my interest in how 
neuromodulators like dopamine influence network stability and information flow.

### How to run
Open the notebook in Jupyter:

```
dopamine_network_simulation.ipynb
```

### Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
